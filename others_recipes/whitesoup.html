    <img src="whitesoup_images/whitesoup.jpg" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      White soup is a delicacy peculiar to the Igbo tribe of Nigeria, especially
      the people of Abia state. White soup is known as ofe nsala because palm
      oil is not used for the preparation, unlike other traditional soups.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        In a pot, bring your yam slices to a boil and cook till it’s soft. Mash
        with the aid of either a food processor or mortar and pestle to form a
        fine dough then set aside
      </li>
      <li>
        Boil water and then add to the bowl containing your cat fish, allow to
        sit for about 5 minutes for the slime to come out. Drain after and scrap
        out the slime with a knife.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blend your spices together, that is your uziza seeds, ogiri and
        crayfish. Wash and slice your Uziza and Utazi leaves then set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pot on medium heat, add your catfish, season with Maggi
        crayfish, salt, dry pepper and add water to the level of the fish. Bring
        to a boil till almost done then add your yam dough (Pounded yam) in bits
        till it’s dissolved into the broth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add your blended spice mix of ogiri, crayfish and uziza seeds. Stir well
        to combine and allow to simmer for 3 minutes. Taste for seasoning and
        adjust if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        After which, add your utazi and uziza leaves sparingly so that the
        leaves don’t overshadow the soup (remember it’s a light soup), stir into
        the soup, allow to simmer for a couple of minutes then take off heat.
      </li>
    </ol>
