    <p>
      Afang soup is a tasty, nutritious Nigerian soup, native to the
      Efiks/Ibibios (Akwa Ibom & Cross river states).
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Beef</li>
      <li>Fish</li>
      <li>Palm oil</li>
      <li>Crayfish</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>Shaki (cow tripe)</li>
      <li>Waterleaf</li>
      <li>Okazi leaf</li>
      <li>Onion</li>
      <li>Periwinkle</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Some seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Just go ahead and start parboiling the meat with all the necessary
        ingredients (2 cubes of knorr, half cup of sliced onions, salt and other
        spice of choice)
      </li>
      <li>
        Some people wash the water leaves before slicing them while others
        choose to slice them before washing; I prefer the latter. Slice and wash
        the water leaves and set aside in a plastic sieve to make sure that
        water is properly drained away.
      </li>
      <li>
        Most people donâ€™t like a trace of water in their afang soup, that can be
        easily arranged, just try to squeeze the water leaves tightly before you
        add them to the soup.
      </li>
      <li>
        Soak the dried fish with warm water, remove the center bones and wash
        thoroughly with just water; also wash the stockfish head with warm
        water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add them to the cooking meat and cook till they are soft and the pot is
        almost dry.
      </li>
      <li>Add the palm oil, stir all together.</li>
      <li>Add a seasoning cube, ground pepper, snails and salt to taste</li>
      <li>Allow cooking for 3-5 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Add the water-leaves; allow to simmer for 5 minutes before adding the
        periwinkles, ground ukazi, and ground crayfish Stir all together
      </li>
      <li>
        cover the pot and allow simmering for another 5 minutes, stirring every
        2 minutes
      </li>
    </ol>
